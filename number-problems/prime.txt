Step 1: Check if a single number is prime

	Input: Read an integer num from the user.
	Check if num is prime:
	If num is less than 2, it is not prime.
	Otherwise, iterate from 2 to num - 1 and check if num is divisible by any number in this range.
	If num is divisible by any number, it is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.

Output: Print whether num is a prime number or not.

Step 2: Find all prime numbers in a given range

	Input: Read two integers start and end from the user.
	Iterate through all numbers from start to end:
	For each number in this range, check if it is prime using the same logic as in Step 1.
	If the number is prime, add it to a list.

Output: Print the list of prime numbers in the given range.

    return primes
